== ZHdK Rails Development Box (on VirtualBox) ==

This repository contains configuration files and setup information
to set up a fresh virtual development environment for the ZHdK Rails
projects:

 http://github.com/psy-q/madek
 http://github.com/psy-q/leihs

The goal is to provide a few configuration files that you can use
to set up a (virtual) Linux environment based on Linux Mint Debian Edition.

This environment then allows you to run the Rails projects and start
hacking on them without having to install all sorts of tools to your own
workstation.

Also, the projects work best and are easiest to install on Linux, so 
this virtual Linux environment is useful for Mac OS X users.


== Setup ==


=== Using our pre-existing virtual hard disk images ===

 1. Download VirtualBox from virtualbox.org. If you're using
    Linux, you can install this directly from your package manager
    instead (e.g. apt-get install virtualbox-ose)

 2. Download our virtual disk image from www.psy-q.ch/zhdk/foo TODO!

 3. Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox. Use the "Linux" -> "Debian"
    type and give it at least 512 MB of memory. Do NOT create a new hard 
    disk image. Use the one you downloaded at step 2 instead.

 4. You're ready to go! You actually don't need any of the files from
    this repository because everything's already preinstalled in our
    image :)

=== Creating your own virtual Linux Mint installation ===
