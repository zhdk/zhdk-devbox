== ZHdK Rails Development Box (on VirtualBox) ==

This repository contains configuration files and setup information
to set up a fresh virtual development environment for the ZHdK Rails
projects:

 http://github.com/zhdk/madek
 http://github.com/zhdk/leihs

The goal is to provide a few configuration files that you can use
to set up a (virtual) Linux environment based on Linux Mint Debian Edition.

This environment then allows you to run the Rails projects and start
hacking on them without having to install all sorts of tools to your own
workstation.

Also, the projects work best and are easiest to install on Linux, so 
this virtual Linux environment is useful for Mac OS X users.


== Setup ==


=== Using our pre-existing virtual hard disk images ===

 1. Download VirtualBox from virtualbox.org. If you're using
    Linux, you can install this directly from your package manager
    instead (e.g. apt-get install virtualbox-ose)

 2. Download our virtual disk image and OVF file:
    
    http://www.psy-q.ch/stuff/zhdk-devbox/zhdk-rails-dev-environment-2.0.ovf
    http://www.psy-q.ch/stuff/zhdk-devbox/zhdk-rails-dev-environment-2.0.vmdk

    That's a total of about 3 GB.

 3. Start VirtualBox and select "Import Appliance..." from the pulldown
    menu. Import the ovf file you downloaded in step 2, then start the 
    resulting virtual machine.

 4. You're ready to go! You actually don't need any of the files from
    this repository because everything's already preinstalled in our
    image :)

 5. Log in with username "user", password "user". The root password, if 
    you need it, is "root".


== Bookmarks ==

The firefox_bookmarks.json file contains bookmarks pointing to all ZHdK Rails projects
at GitHub for your convenience!
